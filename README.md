# üö∞ kitchen_sink

Starting a new ML project requires setting up environments, handling dependencies and generally spending a lot of time just setting everything up. What we really want to spend our time doing is exploring our data and working on our models, and that's why `kitchen_sink` is here to help you out!

The notebooks in this repo are set up for common ML project types (with more to come) and come pre-built with sections for each stage of your ML project, from setup and installation to final model export. It also has a number of sections to help with your data preprocessing (remembered to scale or center your data? `kitchen_sink` has got you covered!) and prompts that will be specific to your particular project type.

Because everything is a notebook everything is also noted and explained with prose, and you're welcome to add and remove cells in line with your project.
